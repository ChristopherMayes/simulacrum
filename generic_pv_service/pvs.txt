# Define your PVs in here.
# Lines that begin with "#" are comments, and ignored by the service.
# The format is as follows:
# PV_NAME TYPE INITIAL_VAL
# Where PV_NAME is what you want the PV to be called
# TYPE is a string corresponding to a python type: (str, float, int, bool, or bytes)
# INITIAL_VAL is the value you want the PV to have at the start.
# Here's a full example:
# GDET:FEE1:241:ENRC float 3.3
# Will create a PV called GDET:FEE1:241:ENRC, that holds a floating point number, initially 3.3
